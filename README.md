# CAFBrain

**Capital Area Food Bank's Generative AI Assistant** for Fundraising and Communications Teams

CAFBrain is an AI-powered Streamlit application designed to transform, query, and refine fundraising and communication materials. Built with LLMs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and multimodal input handling, it empowers users to generate grant proposals, blogs, presentations, and reports using their own source files‚Äîwith full human-in-the-loop refinement and download support.
